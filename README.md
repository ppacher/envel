# Envel

`envel` (temporary project name) is an event-loop driven Lua VM written in GoLang and targeted for home-automation and monitoring. It is currently under active development and should be considered unstable. It's current purpose is mainly to drive my personal smart home without the need of vendor specific cloud features.

More to come :)

If you still like to get an idea of how `envel` can be used check out the default configuration in [./rc.lua](./rc.lua)
